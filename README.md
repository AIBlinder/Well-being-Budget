# Well-being-Budget Abstract
We, the team, AI blinders have chosen the second problem, 'Financial well-being' and the solution for Manoj's problem is quite simple.
We have taken a 20-50-30 rule where he should have a minimum of 20% as his savings, a maximum of 50% of his total income can be used for
utility bills and a maximum of 30% can be used as discretionary expenses.

Coming to how we have actually put this into action is that we ask Manoj for his required expenses and format this into the 20-50-30 rule
using his income and compare it with what his actual spend is. When Manoj goes overboard with any of his expenses we remind him to make it
fall into place and provide the required result for the same.

The technology we have used here is the language C++ and it has helped us inculcate this useful programme.

This programme will be very helpful to people who are having a very difficult time in money management. This helps the individual to be 
better at spending, in real time approval to the expenditure and notifications. This program will especially help the millenials to be
better at saving for later. We hope to see that the future generations also move to this technology and get better at life savings.
